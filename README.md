# TheySell
## Inspiration 💡💡💡

- After each march, rally, or inspirational moment of gathering, many of us will have a moment of wondering “What now?” After the Women’s or LQBTQ's 🏳️‍🌈 March last weekend, the work to support gender equality does not stop and it must continue to evolve. 

- TheySell is an initiative to empower women and LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 in Indian society by connecting them to customers worldwide through anonymous and safe selling. In the corporate world. there is a huge gap and discrimination faced by members of the LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈, they often tend to launch their own businesses. 

- As per the survey by CSDS, young Indians are misogynistic and homophobic. Offline small LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 businesses often face discrimination and even sometimes face assault and humiliation. To empower such small businesses we aim to develop an E-commerce platform and healthy community for them.

## What it does  ❓❓❓👁️‍🗨️👁️‍🗨️

- With TheySell, they can sell their goods worldwide without revealing their identities and without the hassle of any middlemen involved. 

- The process will take place considering the utmost safety of women and the LGBTQ community 🏳️‍🌈! TheySell aims to be India’s largest Women + LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 Oriented Product!

## How we built it 🧏‍♂️🙆‍♂️💻💻

- Used python (web3.py) for building and interacting with the contract but had the challenge to also work on web3.js because of the full-stack ability of our application.

- We have used google cloud APIs for language translation purposes so everyone from different regions can use our app without facing any problems.

- We built our website using the following user flow diagram. We built it with Figma, with DeSo and emphasis on Web3.0 in mind. Combining our creativity and research abilities to build a beautiful web application on Figma. Used python, Django, HTML and CSS

## Challenges we ran into 🏃🏃🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️

- The main challenge was to make the product as de-centralized as possible which was achieved by using blockchain. It was also needed to take care of the vulnerabilities that arise due to the de-centralized approach as it is openly visible to the chain.

- For buying tokens converting the number of tokens to rupees and then Rs->ETH conversion is used which was achieved by interacting with an external API. With the aim to achieve de-centralization, CHAINLINK was used to avoid any central party affecting the contract.

- The major challenge was to build efficient contract transactions which cost fewer transaction fees and faster mining of the transaction on the chain. Basically in connecting components, as we use the backend(MongoDB).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎖️🎖️🎖️

- TheySell has been approved to build, design, and implement an application for saving people time and money. This application can be used by people from normal users to professional businessperson who is willing to help the needy but has no time.

- Being able to get communicate using the Blockchain. Working together as a small group.

- Combining our creativity and research abilities to build a beautiful web application on Figma.

## What we learned 🙇‍♂️📝

- By using Requirement gathering Techniques such as Questionnaires, Brainstorming sessions, interviews, and Initial Requirements are gathered and analyzed whether they are feasible for development and determined whether the gathered requirements are unclear, incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory, and then resolving these issues. 

- How to work on a team of half hackathon beginners and half hackathon regulars. 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️
- How to work on a team of half UX/UI designers and researchers and half developers. 💻
- We also learned how to work remotely. We learned how to use new tools for remote work, like VS Code's Live Share features, ngrok for localhost port forwarding, GitHub for collaboration, and how to integrate APIs with the software. 
- Learned to make production-ready cross-platform apps ready to be deployed in real-time.

## What's next for TheySell   👁️‍🗨️👁️‍🗨️💡

- As we know that most people would like to give as much as they do, and we wanted to do something to try to close that gap. For those people in the future, the trusts will prepare some interesting things as a gift to donors. In the future, we can also provide different types of modes like dark mode, reading mode, etc. 
- For the UI part. In the future, if one Trust needs something to donate but lacks things then another Trust can hand over things to that trust which they required.
- We also want to integrate a feature that lets us sort by type of healthcare provider, so that it is easier for patients to search for solutions such as dialysis facilities or lab test providers.
- Transferring over to ReactJS.
